        		<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
            <p><b>Who are you all?</b><br>
            We’re gender hackers! We started out as a few trans folk at Queercon that decided we wanted to organise more for next year to try to bring more trans/non-binary/non-cis people together during Queercon and Defcon.</p>
            <p><b>A group inside of a group?</b><br>
            Okay so we really made this group because we wanted an excuse to make a really cool Defcon badge.</p>
            <p><b>I'm not a cool gender hacker like you all, can I join?</b><br>
            We welcome everyone on Slack as long as you are respectful and contribute to the community. However, we won’t tolerate people joining the group to find someone to hook up with (we will ban you.)<br>For now, we’re keeping the Facebook group exclusive to trans/non-binary/non-cis folks.<br>Please do keep in mind that this is a space for gender hackers to unite and work together as a community.</p>
            <p><b>I've got really specific trans questions-</b><br>
            Send us a <a href="https://twitter.com/_beyondbinaries">DM on Twitter</a> and we'll get back to you.
